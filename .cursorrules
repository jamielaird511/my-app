Act as a senior engineer. Before edits:
1) Propose a plan (files, scope, risks, test plan).
2) Keep scope ≤5 files, ≤300 LOC.
3) No client/server mixing; pages < 250 LOC.
4) Strong typing; validate API inputs with Zod.
5) Non-UI logic → `/lib/estimate/*` with tests.
6) Update ARCHITECTURE.md and STATUS.md when structure changes.
